# blog-cosmic

Built this blog using a headless CMS, with Nuxt.js, GraphQL, and Cosmic!
The purpose of this project is to learn and implement these technologies.
Sometimes you need to take a chance and explore something new.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
